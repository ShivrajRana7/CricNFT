				<p><span style={{color:"#51E8EF"}}>R</span>ISHABH <span style={{color:"#51E8EF"}}>P</span>ANT belongs to the Adam Gilchrist school of Cricketology, a dashing left-handed batsman who keeps wickets as well for his side. Originally from Uttarakhand, Pant had to shift bases quite a few times from a tender age as he targeted playing cricket at the highest level. It was the 2016 U-19 World Cup that brought him fame across the country. He smashed a record-breaking fifty against Nepal while also racking up a ton against Namibia soon after.</p>
                <p>Unlike most southpaws, Pant's strength is mostly in the arc between mid on and square leg as his terrific bat swing causes mayhem on the bowlers. He does pepper the off side too but not as much as the usual left-handed batsman. Picked by the Delhi franchise in the Indian T20 League in 2016, Pant has already shown his skills with quite a few explosive knocks. Although he burst onto the scene as a batsman for the limited-overs format, Pant has also scaled greater heights for Delhi in the domestic circuit as far as the four-day format is concerned.</p>
                <p>He smashed a historical century off just 48 balls in the 2016-17 season while also becoming one of the youngest ever batsmen to record a triple century. Pant finished among the top five run-getters of the season and what stood out was his astonishing strike rate of 107 - unimaginable in this format especially considering his staggering consistency.</p>
                <p>After his mighty batting display for Delhi in the Indian T20 league in 2018, the selectors took a chance with him in the shortest format of the game. He went with the national T20I squad to Sri Lanka to play in the Nidahas trophy 2017. Though he didn't do much in that tournament to justify his selection, Pant was shown faith for the Test squad in the touring Indian team to England in 2018.</p>
				<p>Pant's keeping has been safe and the young lad has shown eagerness to learn with every game which is pleasing. With MS Dhoni announcing his retirement from international cricket, Pant appears to be the perfect successor to keep the legacy going for the wicketkeeper-batsman slot in the Indian team.</p>
