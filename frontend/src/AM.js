He was born on 24th November 1982, and hails from Delhi. He has played for the Indian team in 68 games across all formats. Mishra is an attacking right-arm leg break bowler and can also prove to be a tail-ender batsman when called upon. An accurate bowler, he relies on the flight of the ball and a big leg-break, which is his stock delivery.</p>
